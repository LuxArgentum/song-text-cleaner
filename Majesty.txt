Here      I       am           humbled by Your majes - ty
Covered by Your grace so free
Here      I       am           knowing I’m a sinful man
Covered by the blood of the Lamb


Now      I’ve       found the greatest love
Of  all      is      mine since You laid down Your life
The greatest sacri - fice (2nd x to Chorus 2)


Maj - es - ty,         maj - es - ty
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty - handed but alive in Your hands


Here      I       am           humbled by the love that You give
For - given so that I can for - give
Here      I       stand           knowing that I’m Your de - sire
Sanctified by glory and fire        (To Pre-Chorus)


Maj - es - ty,         maj - es - ty
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty - handed but alive in Your hands
Maj - es - ty,         maj - es - ty
For - ever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your majes - ty
Majes - ty
