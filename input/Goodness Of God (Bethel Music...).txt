Goodness Of God
Bethel Music / Jenn Johnson

Verse 1
I love You Lord, oh Your mercy never fails me 
All my days I've been held in Your hands 
From the moment that I wake up, until I lay my head 
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 

Chorus 1
And all my life You have been faithful 
And all my life You have been so, so good 
With every breath that I am able 
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 

Verse 2
I love Your voice, You have led me through the fire
And in darkest nights  You are close like no other 
I've known You as a father, I've known You as a friend 
And I have lived in the goodness of God

Chorus 1
And all my life You have been faithful 
And all my life You have been so, so good 
With every breath that I am able 
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 

Bridge 
(‘Cause) Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me 
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me 
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now
I give You everything 
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me 

Chorus 2
And all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good 
With every breath that I am able 
Oh, I’m gonna sing of the goodness of God

Chorus 3
'Cause all my life You have been faithful 
And all my life You have been so, so good 
With every breath that I am able 
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 
Oh, I’m gonna sing of the goodness of God
