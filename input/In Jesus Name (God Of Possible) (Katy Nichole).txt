In Jesus Name (God Of Possible)
Katy Nichole

Verse 1
I speak the name of Jesus over you
In your hurting, in your sorrow, I will ask my God to move
I speak the name 'cause its all that I can do
In desperation, I'll seek heaven, and pray this for you

Chorus
I pray for your healing, that circumstances would change
I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus name
I pray that a breakthrough would happen today
I pray miracles over your life, in Jesus name
In Jesus name

Verse 2
I speak the name of all authority
Declaring blessings, ev'ry promise He is faithful to keep
I speak the name no grave could ever hold
He is greater, He is stronger, He's the God of possible

Chorus
I pray for your healing, that circumstances would change
I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus name
I pray that a breakthrough would happen today
I pray miracles over your life, in Jesus name
In Jesus name

Bridge
Come believe it, come receive it
Oh the power of His Spirit is now forever yours
Come believe it, come receive it
In the mighty name of Jesus, all things are possible

Chorus
I pray for your healing, that circumstances would change
I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus name
I pray that a breakthrough would happen today
I pray miracles over your life, in Jesus name

I pray for revival, for restoration of faith
I pray that the dead will come alive
In Jesus name, in Jesus name
