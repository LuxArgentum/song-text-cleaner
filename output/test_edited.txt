VERSE :

Water You turned into wine opened the eyes of the blind

There's no one like You, none like You 



VERSE :

Into the darkness You shine out of the ashes we rise

There's no one like You, none like You 



CHORUS:

Our God is greater our God is stronger

God You are higher than any other

Our God is healer, awesome in power Our God, our God

BRIDGE:

 And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us

 And if our God is with us, then what could stand against

 And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us

 And if our God is with us, then what could stand against
