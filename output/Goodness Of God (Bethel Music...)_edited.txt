Goodness Of God
Bethel Music Jenn Johnson

Verse 
I love You Lord, oh Your mercy never fails me 
All my days I've been held in Your hands 
From the moment that I wake up, until I lay my head 
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 

Chorus 
And all my life You have been faithful 
And all my life You have been so, so good 
With every breath that I am able 
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 

Verse 
I love Your voice, You have led me through the fire
And in darkest nights You are close like no other 
I've known You as a father, I've known You as a friend 
And I have lived in the goodness of God

Chorus 
And all my life You have been faithful 
And all my life You have been so, so good 
With every breath that I am able 
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 

Bridge 
 Cause Your goodness is running after, it s running after me 
Your goodness is running after, it s running after me 
With my life laid down, I m surrendered now
I give You everything 
Your goodness is running after, it s running after me 

Chorus 
And all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good 
With every breath that I am able 
Oh, I m gonna sing of the goodness of God

Chorus 
'Cause all my life You have been faithful 
And all my life You have been so, so good 
With every breath that I am able 
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God 
Oh, I m gonna sing of the goodness of God
